# Petfinder GraphQL Server
This is the code for a GraphQL Server which wraps the [Petfinder API routes](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs).

The GraphQL schema was generated using the [openapi-to-graphql tool](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-to-graphql) along with the [Petfinder OpenAPI Specification](https://api.petfinder.com/openapi.yaml)
